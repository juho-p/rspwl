basics
- subsurfaces
    - map -> configure events
    - unmap -> unconfigure events
    - events: for all surfaces
- logging & cleanup prints
- clear TODOs
- code cleanup & restructure
- make sure input devices & outputs & etc. are cleaned up properly on unplug
- output damage destroy -> drop output?
- wrapper for region32?
- commonize xdg_surface
    - map -> damage
    - unmap -> damage
    - new_popup -> blah

later
- reduce the amount of unsafe %!$¤@
- xdg surfaces: configure & other handling
- floating window resize & move (mod key)
- keyboard handler
- tiling
- tiling swap
- tiling keyboard resize
- tiling mouse resize
- check that output handling works
- ipc
- configuration (keyboard layout, ...)
- wlroots to latest release
- xwayland
- layer-shell
- other protocols
- set WAYLAND_DISPLAY to started applications
- limit render time? similar as sway output "schedule frame" ?
- handle wayland and xdg protocols better
    - wlr_surface_send_enter
    - could handle requests & stuff only when mapped (signal add on map, signal remove on unmap)
- scaling a mystery. bunch of code but does it really work?
- start to understand wlroots input handling: https://drewdevault.com/2018/07/17/Input-handling-in-wlroots.html
